# hate-speech-detection-cnn
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect hate speech in text data. The model is trained on labeled datasets and aims to classify whether a given sentence contains hate speech or not.

Features

Preprocessing of text (tokenization, padding, etc.)

CNN-based model architecture for text classification

Training and evaluation scripts

Model performance visualization

Real-time prediction using user input


Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn
